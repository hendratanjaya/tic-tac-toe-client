So happy to get this project done, really interesting tool to work with,                                                                                                                                                                                                    
learn so many new things, I tried to using components and state to this project to understand how they work, still so much to learn to be honest. 

This project is linked with a [back-end server](https://github.com/hendratanjaya/tic-tac-toe-server) that I developed using Node.js and Express. The server handles game data management, player sessions, and game history, allowing seamless communication between the front-end and back-end. With this architecture, players can enjoy a persistent gameplay experience, where their game history is saved and retrieved dynamically from the server.

Player data is stored in an external database using Vercel Storage(postgresSql), This project simulates standard API request handling, providing a typical experience of interacting with RESTful APIs for data retrieval and updates. Each user will be given an API key, this API Key will be stored in web local storage, and this API Key will be used as an identifier to the server preventing other user to freelyaccessing someone else's data                                                                     
(i hope..). Well at least thats what I have in mind. 

Overall, [this project](https://hendratanjaya.github.io/tic-tac-toe-client/) is FUN!

thank you~
